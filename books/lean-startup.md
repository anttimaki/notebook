## Introduction

* Definition of a startup: **a human institution designed to create new products and services under conditions of extreme uncertainty**
  * Size of the company or the industry doesn't define whether it's a startup or not
  * Startup requires management geared to extreme uncertainty
* *Validated learning*: learning to build sustainable business through frequent experiments
* *Build-measure-learn*: turn ideas into products, measure how customers respond, decide to either pivot or persevere
* *Innovation accounting*: how to measure progress, set up milestones and prioritize work

## Part I: Vision

### 1 Start

* Startup is an exercise in institution building and thus requires management
  * To avoid bureaucracy, it's tempting but dangerous to avoid management, processes and discipline
  * Traditional management practices won't work well under high uncertainty
    * A failure to deliver results is seen either as a failure to plan or a failure to execute
    * In startup, such failures are often required to learn   
* The goal of the startup is to **learn** what's the right thing to build as quickly as possible
  * Due to uncertainty, sticking to rigid plans based on initial assumptions is unlikely to work 
  * Use feedback loops like *build-measure-learn* to steer and pivot when needed instead

### 2 Define

* Established companies are good at *sustaining innovation*: incrementally improving existing products and serving existing customers
* At the same time they are bad at *disruptive innovation*: creating new sustainable sources of growth
* Innovation is a decentralized and unpredictable thing, but can be managed by cultivating entrepreneurship throughout the institution
* Managers need to create the conditions that enable employees to do the kind of experimentation that entrepreneurship requires

### 3 Learn

* One can measure progress by making sure the work proceeds according to plan, is of high quality and within budget, but such progress is illusion if the product is something no one wants
* When working under extreme uncertainty, verifying or refuting assumptions about what the users want - learning - is the most vital function of the organization
  * Distinguish between what we think users want vs. what users say they want vs. what users really want
* *Validated learning*, demonstrating empirically that one has learned what the users really want, is the antidote to successfully executing a plan that leads nowhere
* In lean thinking, value equals providing benefit to the customer; anything else is waste
  * In startup, learning what provides benefits to the customer is therefore progress; anything that doesn't contribute to learning is waste
  * E.g. shipping a MVP for early feedback is better than wasting time to ship a polished product (that no one might use)
* Show me the data: make decision based on empirical data collected from real customers, otherwise you're just guessing
* In Lean Startup model, every product, feature and marketing campaign is an experiment designed to achieve validated learning

### 4 Experiment

* *Just do it* methodology: ship a product and see what happens
  * If the plan is to see what happens, succeeding means seeing what happened, but that doesn't amount to validated learning
* *Lean startup* methodology is based on scientific method: start with a hypothesis and experiment to see if it's true
* Observe real customer behaviour instead of asking hypothetical questions
* *Value hypothesis* tests whether a product delivers value to customers once they're using it
* *Growth hypothesis* tests how new customers discover the product
* An experiment is more than just a theoretical inquiry: it's also the first version of the product
* Avoid spending engineering time on a product until you've figured out whether you can make it and sell it
* "Success is not delivering a feature; success is learning how to solve the customer's problem"

## Part II: Steer

* *Build-measure-learn* loop:
  1. Build ideas into a product
  2. Measure product to get data
  3. Learn from the data to get ideas
* Planning happens in reverse order:
  1. Figure out what you need to learn
  2. Figure out what you need to measure to gain validated learning
  3. Figure out the product you need to get that measurement
* Minimize the **total** time through this feedback loop
* MVP is the version of the product that enables a full turn of the BML-loop with minimum effort and development time

### 5 Leap

* *Leap of faith*: a business critical assumption, that if true, provides tremendous opportunity; but if false, there's a high risk of total failure
  * Usually *value hypothesis* and *growth hypothesis* are the biggest leaps of faiths for a startup

### 6 Test

* The lesson of the MVP is that any additional work beyond what was required to start learning is waste, no matter how important it might have seemed at the time
* MVPs for testing the *value hypothesis*:
  * a narrated video describing how the product should work can be used to get waiting list subscriptions
  * a concierge service, i.e. a human acting with the customer does the tasks that are supposed to be automated by the product
    * Manually doing the tasks also teaches what are the actual problems that need to be solved and automated
  * the wizard of Oz: users interact with frontend, but there's no backend - instead it's humans completing the tasks again
* "If we don't know who the customer is, we don't know what quality is"
  * Don't stress over the low quality of a MVP, it's only a stepping stone towards quality product
  * Feedback on low quality reveals the parts the customers really care about
* When building MVP, remove any feature, process, or effort that doesn't contribute directly to the learning you seek

### 7 Measure

* A startup should rigorously measure where it's right now, and devise experiments to learn how to move the numbers closer to the ideal
  * How do you know the changes you've done are the cause for the results you're seeing?
* *Innovation accounting*
  1. Use MVP to establish a baseline, i.e. gather real data where the company is right now
  2. Make all the micro changes you can to tune the product, and see if the metrics improve from the baseline
  3. Pivot (restart from step 1) or persevere
* Product "progress" (=micro changes) is meaningless if it doesn't improve business results (=metrics)
* *Cohort analysis*: instead of cumulative metrics, look at each group of users that start using the product ("cohort") independently to see if the metrics are improving from cohort to cohort
  * ❌: "We have 10% more downloads in May than the previous month"
  * ✅: "The users who registered during May made on average 10% more downloads than the newly registered users did during the previous month"
* *Vanity metrics*:
  * e.g. gross revenue, where the growth is not coming from the product getting better, but from the increase in marketing expenses
  * e.g. number of users, when they use the free version, but the percentage of paying customers isn't increasing within new cohorts
* Adding "Validated" as the last stage of kanban flow: after the change is complete from technical point of view, test and see if it should have been built in the first place (e.g. via A/B testing)
  * Without a clear hypothesis to test, a feature can't be validated, and work on it shouldn't start in the first place
* The Three A's of metrics:
  * Actionable: demonstrate clear cause and effect (A/B testing)
  * Accessible: simple, understandable reports that are available to everyone
  * Auditable: the data behind the report should also be accessible, to make it difficult to deny a report with displeasing results

### 8 Pivot (or Persevere)

* Companies that can't bring themselves to pivot based on the feedback from the marketplace can get stuck; neither growing enough not dying, consuming resources that could better be used elsewhere
* While the decision to pivot is ultimately done based on intuition, *innovation accounting* brings relevant data to the table
* The more money, time and effort has been spent on the idea, the harder it is to pivot
  * Use MVPs to reduce the spending required to see if the idea works
  * Deciding on actionable metrics before staring makes it easier to see whether a pivot is required or not
* *Zoom-in pivot*: refocus so that a single feature of the old product becomes the whole product
* *Zoom-out pivot*: add more features when the single feature doesn't support the business
* *Customer segment pivot*: keep the functionality the same, but change the audience focus
* *Customer need pivot*: after getting to know your customers, solve a bigger need they have than the one you originally planned to solve
* *Business architecture pivot*: move from "high margin, low volume" business to "low margin, high volume" business, or vice versa
* *Platform pivot*: become a platform, facilitating business between parties
* *Channel pivot*: change the distribution channel, e.g. news from newspapers to internet
* *Technology pivot*: solve and old problem using new superior technology
* Startup's *runway* is usually seen as the remaining cash divided by monthly burn rate
  * Reducing costs can lengthen this runway, but may also slow down it's BML feedback loop, and the company only goes out of business more slowly
  * Thus runway should be seen as the number of pivots the company has left before going out of business
  * Extend the runway by going through pivots faster, i.e. achieve validated learning faster/cheaper
* Early success can blind the startup from seeing that they need to do a customer segment pivot from early adopters to mainstream customers
  * When the micro changes on the product have diminishing results on the metrics, it might be the time to make this pivot
  * Since the groups have different needs and the latter group is more demanding, the company needs to restart the innovation accounting cycle to improve UX, quality and other things the early adopters are willing to forgive, but the mainstream users aren't

## Part III: Accelerate

### 9 Batch

* Lean basics: working on smaller batches reduces WIP and makes problems visible earlier, thus helping produce more units
  * For a startup, smaller batches can be used to learn how to build a sustainable business as quickly as possible
* Continuous deployment should include an "immune system" for measuring the impact of all introduced changes
  * Think of unit tests, but ones that check the business metrics in production are not impacted negatively
  * Defective changes should be removed immediately and automatically, and the relevant team notified about the problem

### 10 Grow

* New customers come from the actions of the past customers
  * Word of mouth
  * Side effect of product usage (e.g. receiving money via PayPal makes the receiver a new user)
  * Advertising
    * To be sustainable, the cost of acquiring a new customer must be lower than the revenue they generate
  * Retention (subscription, repurchases)
* Once a startup has a product in the market, they tend to waste time arguing about how to prioritize new development
  * Usually time is spent in marginal optimizations instead of focusing on big experiments that lead to validated learning
  * Engines of growth provide small sets of metrics that actually matter to focus on
* *Engine of growth*: the mechanism that a startup uses to achieve sustainable (=exclude one-time activities) growth
  * Should work as self-feeding feedback-loop
  * *Sticky EoG*: attract and retain customer for long term
    * E.g. vendor lock
    * Track number of new customers vs. churn rate
  * *Viral EoG*: growth as a side effect of product usage
    * Track viral coefficient: how many new customers does each new costumer bring with them
    * Typically viral products are free (to reduce friction in starting to use the product), which makes testing the value hypothesis difficult
  * *Paid EoG*: advertising or e.g. cost from sales representatives on B2B sales
    * Track *Cost Per Acquisition* and *LifeTime Value*
  * While a company may have multiple EoGs working at the same time, it's usually best to focus on one (and pivot if necessary)
  * All EoGs run out eventually. Companies that have been following vanity metrics and working on features that don't actually affect customer behaviour are in trouble when that happens

### 11 Adapt

* Adaptive organization uses experimentation to constantly adjust its processes to suit current conditions
* Use The Five Whys to find out the root cause to fix when ever any kind of failure is encountered
* *Proportional investment*: use little time to fix small annoyances, and more time for bigger problems
  * Alternatively: use little time the first time the problem occurs, and more and more if the problem keeps reoccurring
* "Be tolerant of all mistakes the first time; never allow the same mistake to be made twice", i.e. improve tools/processes/system to avoid repeating known failures

### 12 Innovate

* Startup teams require:
  1. Scarce but secure resources
  2. Independent authority to develop their business
    * Executing experiments without requiring constant approvals
    * Cross-functional, self-reliant team
  3. Personal stake in the outcome
* Creative managers should stick to innovating features and let others handle the commercialization, optimization, and scaling of proven ideas
