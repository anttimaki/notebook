## Defining Success

* In growth mindset, success is achieved by working towards improving one's skills
* Success can be seen a as goal, which when pursuited and/or achieved, improves the quality of one's life
* Good vibes leads to regular exercise, which leads to resting better, which improves one faculties, which makes it easier to learn, which improves quality of work, which makes it easier to give more to the community, which leads to receiving more
* One's everyday life should reflect one's goals, otherwise achieving them is unlikely
* Making one's meaningful values and goals crystal clear makes it easier to make choices in everyday life

## Case: Timo Lappi

* Joy of missing out: freedom from disregarding things that don't adhere to your values without FOMO
* Feeling of inadequacy wears you out; excessive satisfaction slows you down
* For a company, growth doesn't need to mean just financial growth, it can also be e.g. better UX or organizational know-how

## First You Must Know Yourself

* Making the goals crystal clear is crucial part of (self)-management
  * Memento Mori: life is short, so only reach for the goals that are meaningful to you
  * Use regular retrospection to see if the goal is still meaningful and if the current approach is working
* Goal -> plan -> Action
  * Compare the current status to the goal to understand what needs to change
  * Focus on only a few goals at a time (=prioritize)
  * Start with small, easy steps and stop for retrospection
  * Too specific or far-reaching plans will go stale as the world around you changes
* Failure is not forbidden. Failure is temporary and helps you to improve

## Identify the Obstacles for Success

* Use discipline to form habits instead of for fighting your daily thoughts
  * Work on forming a single habit at a time to improve chances of success
* DRAMMA model to recover from work, i.e. how to use leisure time:
  * *Detachment*: do something completely different than what your work is like
  * *Relaxation*: avoid physically/mentally exhausting tasks
  * *Autonomy*: do stuff that you have full control over
  * *Mastery*: do something that you're good at to get feelings of success
  * *Meaning*: do things you consider meaningful
  * *Affiliation*: surround yourself with people who give you energy

## Finding Meaning and Direction

* Ikigai (iki = life, gai = fulfilling one's wishes and expectations, ikigai = reason to live)
  1. What do you like to do?
  2. What are you good at?
  3. What does the world need?
  4. What is someone willing to pay for?
* GROW model
  * *Goal*: set realistic, clear-cut goals
  * *Reality*: what is the situation now and how it differs from the goal?
  * *Options*: what are the Obstacles/Options for proceeding towards the goal?
  * *Way forward*: concrete next steps to move towards the goal
* Forget "I must", "I need to", and "when the time is right"
* Good life comes from clarity; get rid of things, tasks and habits that don't spark joy

## Designing a High Quality Life

* Applying design thinking to life
  1. *Emphatize*: Discard prejudice and beliefs and truly listen to yourself
  2. *Define*: Based on the findings, define the issue to be solved in a way that doesn't commit to any particular solution
  3. *Brainstorm*: Come up with as many solutions as possible, regardless of their feasibility, then focus on the best ones
  4. *Prototype*: Do lightweight tests to see if the solutions seem to work
  5. *Experiment*: If the prototype seems to work, invest more time, effort and money to it
  * The process isn't linear, e.g. jumping back to redefine the issue is ok
* Testing things out for testing's sake: the result doesn't need to be complete or success, just testing the idea increases understanding 
* If an issue seems impossible to solve, it's likely just a lack of vision; try to see it from different perspective
* Don't say "maybe" or "later" to things you don't want to do, just say "no"
* Finding opportunities likely requires other people, so don't get isolated

## Case: Joni Jaakkola

* Review your thoughts. They're not the truth, challenge them and make conscious decisions
  * Try to become a better friend with the voice inside your head
* Daring to publish unpolished work creates feedback earlier, which leads to faster improvement
* Decide what to focus on, improve it systematically
* Wellbeing of an entrepreneur
  1. Self care: delegate work (especially the boring stuff); make clear distinction between work and free time
  2. Care for others: take care of individual employees and the community as a whole
  3. Care for customers 
* Time is limited. Are you prepared to abandon something you're currently doing to make room for the new thing?

## Case: Timur Kärki

* Don't let society define what good life is and entails. Find your own focus in life
* Success and good life aren't static values, regular introspection is necessary
