## Part 1: Perspectives on Trust

Three skills that a trusted advisor needs:

1. Earning trust
2. Giving advice effectively
3. Building relationships

### 2. What Is a Trusted Advisor?

* Focus on the client as an individual, not as a person fulfilling a role
* Success in client relations is tied to accumulation of quality experiences
* In a TA relationship both client and advisor are able to be who they are
  * No need to expend energy protecting oneself
  * Can be open with information about their lives, strengths and weaknesses

### 3. Earning Trust

* When building trust, keep your self-interest in check
* Trust can be won and lost very rapidly
* Trust results from accumulated experiences, over time
* While outstanding technical competence is required, it's not sufficient
  * Trust is a lot richer that logic alone, and a significant component of success
* You can't create a TA relationship on your own, the client must participate and reciprocate
  * This means you must select carefully who to attempt to build a TA relationship with
* Just because you can trust doesn't mean you can be trusted. However, if you can't trust, you probably can't be trusted.

### 4. How to Give Advice

* Giving advice is rarely exclusively logical process, it's often an emotional duet between the parties. Recognizing and responding to client emotions is critical.
* It's not enough to be right - advisor's job is to be helpful
* Critiquing one's client is a part of the job. Improvement suggestions always carry implied critique. The person hiring you is often responsible for the current state of affairs. The proposed solution need to consider the sensitivities, emotions and politics of the client situation.
* Don't just provide solutions, help the client to understand the why
* Saying client must do something is likely to evoke emotional resistance
  * If client refuses, the discussion becomes an argument
  * Instead, make the client participate in a discussion about options
* Successful advisor assumes responsibility for the proper mutual understanding
* A Teacher's task is to help a student from A (what they know/understand/believe now) to B (deeper understanding and knowledge).
  * Teacher must undertand A
    * What does the student understand now
    * Why do they believe/do what they currently believe/do
    * What messages are they ready for
    * To do this, question and listen - save your reactions for later
  * Teacher must provided a step-by-step reasoning process to achieve B
  * E.g.:
    * Why do you think we have this problem?
    * What alternatives do we have, and what are their advantages and benefits?
    * How would relevant players react to different alternatives?
    * Others have encountered the following probles, how can they be mitigated?
* Process for advisor:
  1. Give them their options
  2. Educate them about the options, including discussion for considering each option in depth
  3. Give them a recommendation
  4. Let them choose
* Most meetings benefit from a summary of what was decided
  * Building trust requires reducing ambiquities
* The advisor needs to quicky understand each individuals preferred style of interaction and adapt to it. "Take it or leave it"-approach with fixed consultative style wont work.

### 5. The Rules of Romance: Relationship Building

* A primary goal of any relationship-building activity is to create opportunities to *demonstrate* that you have something to contribute. Best way to do this is to start contributing.
* Ask a lot of questions, shut up, and listen
* The most common form of communication breakdown (and a major source of lost trust) is misunderstanding about what has been said.
* TA can be relied upon to tell the truth, including bad news, and always with tact and care
* Professionals may feel the need to project an aura of complete mastery in order to win trust, but it's not so
* Keep clients talking about themselves, but don't do so as a phony tactic. Instead, ask questions to learn as much as possible about the person and how they can be influenced.
  * It's also crucial to remember the answers to the questions you've asked

### 6. The Importance of Mindsets

* Exclusive professionalism: the advisor is the sole professional
  * Leads incorrectly to think that advisor should solve the problem rather than help the client to solve the problem
  * Reinforces the belief that advisor must "control" or "manage" client interarctions and relationships
* Inclusive professionalism: acknowledging and engaging the professionalism of others
  * Use unique talents of each party for greater good
  * Joint responsibility of effectiveness of work

### 7. Sincerity or Technique?

* Reputation before revenue

## Part 2: The Structure of Trust-building

### 8. The Trust Equation

* *Trustworthiness* = (*Credibility* + *Reliability* + *Intimacy*) / *Self-orientation*
* *Credibility* is important, so we tend to spent time on our logic, facts and credentials: all appeals to rationality
  * Emotional side of *credibility*: convey honesty
    * Figure out how to tell as much truth as possible, except where doing so would injure others
    * Don't tell lies or exaggerate, at all
    * When you don't know, say so, quickly and directly
    * Love your topic. It will show.
* Best professionals anticipate needs and speak about needs that are commonly not articulated
* *Reliability* is action oriented: whereas *credibility* is words, *reliability* links words to deeds and intentions to action.
  * A good advisor will find or create opportunities to demonstrate reliability by making promises, explicit or implicit, and then delivering on them.
* People trust those with whom they are willing to talk about difficult agendas (*intimacy*), and those who demonstrate that they care (low *self-orientation*).
  * The most common failure of building trust is the lack of intimacy
  * It is possible to have an intimate relationship without sharing personal information
* People distrust those who appear to be more interested in themselves than serving the client. It takes effort to show *self-orientation* is under control.
  * Threats to client-orientation:
    * Desire to look intelligent or to be right
    * Desire to win exceeds desire to serve
    * Fear of not knowing, of not appearing competent, of being rejected
    * Preoccupation with your own agenda
  * Uninspiring work leads to self-orientation

### 9. The Development of Trust

* Five steps of developing trust in relationship:
  1. Engage
    * Attention becomes focused
  2. Listen
    * Acknowledge and affirm
  3. Frame
    * The root issue is stated clearly and openly
  4. Envision
    * A vision of alternate reality
  5. Commit
    * Steps are agreed upon
* During *engagement* client begins to feel there's an issue worth talking about, and you're worth talking to about the issue in an open, truthful manner.
  * Requires the advisor to be credibly noticed
* *Listening* is the stage when the client comes to believe the advisor understands them.
  * Be (inter)active and involved
  * Listen to what is said and what's left unspoken
  * Confirm and validate what you've heard.
  * Requires an ability to understand other human beings
* *Frame* the issue by crystallizing and clarifying the many aspects of client's problem
  * Consist of formulating problem statements, hypotheses and points of view around what's important to the client
  * Purpose is to reveal and organize the issues so that all parties understand them clearly in a common way, so that the process can move forward with clarity
  * When successful, builds trust and is essential part of giving advice
  * Requires creative insight and emotional courage
* *Envisioning* concretizes a vision and choice among possible future states
  * What are we really aiming for and how do we know we've achieved it?
  * Requires spirit of collaboration and creativity
* In *commit* phase, ensure the client understands (rationally, emotionally and politically) what it will take to achieve the vision
  * Help client to find the determination to do what's necessary
  * Commmitment leads to action (by the client or the advisor)
  * Expectation management
  * Requires ability to control enthusiasm, in both directions

### 10. Engagement

* Engagement is a prerequisite for listening: without the initial connection the client is not willing to discuss matters with the advisor
* For client, discussing matters with others requires emotional energy and is a personal risk, which is not taken unless the client sees a likelihood of positive outcome
* Advisor needs to indicate quickly that they understand (not deliver on) the wants (not needs) of the client
  * This is an effective attention getter since it demonstrates client-focused world-view
* In an ongoing relationship, getting clients to open up requires providing something sufficiently new, intriguing and exiting
  * While getting an audience with existing client is easier, advisor still needs to get the client to re-engage and open up
* For new clients, find out everything you can about them
 * Make sure you have 2-3 topics for discussion, while avoiding overused and stale topics
 * Make sure you can add some value, or postpone the meeting until you can

### 11. The Art of Listening

* Effective TAs are very good listeners. It's required, but not sufficient.
* By listening the TA earns the right to be involved and offer advice
  * Cutting to the chase without listening first is easily interpreted as arrogance
* Rational understanding of issues in not enough. Our desire to be heard flows from our need for respect, empathy and involvement. TA recognizes this and ensures that the self-esteem of the client is protected.
* Good listening is active, providing acknowledgment to the other party
  * For purely rational messages, nods and "mm-hmm" might be sufficient
  * For messages carrying emotional flavor, also the acknowledgement needs to use emotive colorings and tones. Simple "mm-hmm" here signals the advisor only cares about the rational content, not the client.
  * E.g. if the client tells something they're proud or embarrassed about, it should be acknowledged
* When setting an agenda, asking the client "what else should we discuss today?" or "what do we have to accomplish with today's meeting?" allows the clients to tell us what's on their minds and what their priorities are
  * At the start of the meeting, make the agenda itself a subject for discussion
  * Agenda should be co-owned, this sends a signal of working together and gets the client involved
* Good listeners:
  1. Probe for clarification
  2. Spot hidden assumptions
  3. Summarize well
  4. Listen for what's different, not what's similar
  5. Keep the client talking, ask for more details in order to understand
  6. Listen for unvoiced emotion
  7. Spot differences between what client says and their gestures and posture
  8. Ask how client feels about the discussed things
  9. Emphatize
  10. Ask how client thinks you can be of help
* Good listeners don't:
  1. Interrupt
  2. Respond or try to solve the problem too soon
  3. Give their ideas before hearing client's ideas
  4. Jump into conclusions (much less to judgements)
  5. Editorialize in midstream (e.g. reject an idea)

### 12. Framing the Issue

* *Framing* is the act of crystallizing and encapsulating the client's complex issues and emotions into a problem definition that provides insight and fresh way of thinking about the problem in an objective manner
* An accureta problem statement is more than a halfway to the solution
* Humans are limited in the number of perspectives we can consider simultaneously. Progress towards solution requires that someone manages to simplify the complexity into a problem statement.
* Rational framing is necessary, but emotional components need to be considered too, otherwise they will prevent the ideas and conversation from flowing freely
* Emotional framing is about surfacing hidden emotions
* Remember that the point is to frame the client's emotions, not yours
* *Naming and claiming*: articulate what was previously too uncomfortable to be stated
  1. Acknowledge the difficulty of raising the issue
  2. Accept the responsibility for raising it
  3. State the issue directly
* Most initial framing attempts (especially by clients) are laden with blame
  * Framing by TA needs to be sufficiently free of blame

### 13. Envisioning an Alternate Reality

* In *envisioning*, the advisor and the client jointly imagine what end result might look like
  1. For what are we really aiming here?
  2. What will it look like when we get there?
  3. How will we know we're there?
* Resist the temptation (yours and client's) of jumping from *framing* to *committing* to action
* With clear understanding of the destination, both parties have articulated what is at stake and what the solution is, and are ready to talk about "what to do about it?"

### 14. Commitment

* *Commitment* refers to ensuring that the client understands what will be necessary to solve the problem and is willing to do what it takes to achieve the goals
  1. What's going to get in the way of getting this done?
  2. What do we intend to do about it?
  3. Who needs to be brought into the loop?
  4. Who should do what part?
  5. What information do we need?
  6. When shall we check in?
  7. What are the key deadlines?
* Only by understanding the implementation details, difficulties and what's required from them, can the client fully commit to the project.
* Clients often commit to little less than they could to leave some room to maneuver, don't be disheartened by this
* A central part of the step is managing client's expectation about what is and is not going to happen. When done properly, this builds trust.
  1. Clearly articulate what the advisor will and will not do
  2. Clearly articulate what the client will and will not do
  3. Agree on methods and frequency of communicating
  4. Decide which reports are delivered to who and how often
  5. Decide what milestones and progress reviews are needed
  6. Decide how success will be measured, both at the end and during the process
* Client's resistance to taking actions is often caused by failing to build necessary trust during the earlier steps
  * Also fear and complacency may cause resistance. *Name and claim* to diffuse fears, use trust capital to push client forward.

## Part 3: Putting Trust to Work

### 15. What's So Hard About All This?

* Most common mistake is jumping ahead in trust process to taking action. This is common because:
  1. The human tendency to focus on ourselves
  2. The belief that we're selling only content
  3. The desire for tangibility
  4. The search for validation
* TA is someone who is capable of devoting themself, their carind and attention to the client.
  * Biggest obstacle to this is devoting the same things to ourselves out of self-centered fear: fear of losing what we have or not getting what we want

### 16. Different Client Types

* Try to find something that's special, fun, meaningful, or engaging about the client you can relate to.
  * Doing this will make it easier to behave appropriately

1. *Just the facts* client
  * "Just give me the facts. Answer when asked. Don't sell me. I'm the boss."
  * This is a plea to be understood, or masking fear of being wrong.
  * Use client's language, clarify and confirm their values and then behave that way.
2. *I'll get back to you* client
 * "I don't want to make any promises here. I have to think about it. I'll get back to you later."
 * Client is nervous about making judgements and commitments on the spot, preferring to think things through
 * Plan on them being that way and plan to make it easier for them
3. *You're the expert, dummy* client
  * "I cant spent time educating you. What's the answer?"
  * Client wants to dominate you
  * Don't call the bluff, instead provide value in the form of a number of hypotheses
4. *Let me handle that* client
  * "This is good stuff, but you don't know the politics. I'll take care of it."
  * They don't trust you - try to build trust
  * They don't trust anyone - use *naming and claiming* in private
5. *Let's go through this again* client
  * "The fifth draft is coming along well, but the nuances are what kill you."
  * Detail orientation masks the desire to control things, and gets in the way of big-picture approaches. Make big-picture feel comfortable.
6. *You don't understand* client
  * "You don't understand our business. You're new here, you wouldn't get it."
  * Client wants to feel special
  * Ask the client to help you understand, demonstrate the similarities with what you know
7. *Enemy's enemy is a friend* client
  * "This isn't going to play with the board. Don't mention this to legal. What does this mean to Alice?"
  * Client loves office politics
  * Don't debate or critize their approach. Make it part of the content, talk about it freely.
8. *Just like, you know, come on* client
  * "I want you to, uh, you know, make it happen."
  * Client's strengths aren't in (verbal) communication. Give them alternatives.
  * Give a voice to their needs
  * Write up options they can react to by ranking or rating
  * Don't expect open-ended questions to work
9. "Oh, by the way" client
  * "I should have invited you that meeting we just had. I should have sent you a memo about this thing"
  * Client has a personal issue with you, or sees you as a single-domain expert with nothing to offer outside it
  * In a private meeting, use *naming and claiming*. *Engage* the client. Give them a reason to believe you're valuable.

### 17. Lieutenant Columbo Approach

### 18. The Role of Trust in Getting Hired

* Selling and providing a service are closely related
* Combine the professional perspective of always seeking opportunities for delivering value in ways which haven't already been noticed
* Sell by demonstrating you have something to offer and can be trusted
  * This is serving the client by helping them meeting their needs, acting as a TA and a caring professional
* Advisors are often uncomfortable selling, assuming (sometimes) incorrectly that quality of their work speaks for itself and the value of the service is self-evident for the client
  * Don't think about it as selling, think about it as getting hired
* Buyer is often facing many forms of risks: financial, emotional, wasted time, embarrassment, career risk
  * Demonstrate how it feelds to work together to alleviate the fears
* Most would agree that an advisor has a professional obligation to warn client about bad things about to happen
  * We should therefore do the same if see a signifigant opportunity for improvement
  * See selling as noticing legitimate opportunities for improvement and raising the awareness of the client about their signifigance and benefits

### 19. Building Trust on the Current Assignment

* Inreasing the **perceived** value of your service and promoting trust:
  1. Understanding
  2. Sense of control, progress, and importance
  3. Access, availability, and responsiveness
  4. Appreciation and respect
  5. Reliability
* Additional ways of building trust
  1. Involve the client (brainstorming, assigning tasks to client, letting the client choose from provided options, keeping the client informed)
  2. Help the client use what was delivered (coaching, help understand the reasoning, advicing how to share the results internally)
  3. Making meetings more valuable (set agenda, send information in advance, establish next steps, provide summaries promptly)
* Keep client up to date about your progress, ask questions (displays you're working on task) and take the answers into account in your work
* Don't keep the client in dark about difficulties. Tell the truth, not what the client wants to hear.
* Understand how assignment fits in and affects the bigger picture
* Read your earlier notes to detect issues that were raised earlier and haven't been addressed yet
* Expect client's goals and mind to change over time and react appropriately
  * If possible, try to anticipate such changes in advance
* Try to not give only technical answers. Ask how your work affects the client individually and personally. What are the financial, role or career implications?
* Ways of destroying trust
  1. Compromising the confidences of an individual
  2. Not detecting the client has questions, uncertainties or unhappiness about certain aspect of your work
  3. Going around or behind the client to get something done, even if it's important
  4. Engaging "I'm sometimes wrong, but I'm never in doubt" behaviour
  5. Blowing a deadline, regardless of it's importance. Ask extensions for unreasonable deadlines. If the product is going to be late, let it be known as early as possible.

### 20. Re-earning Trust Away from the Current Assignment

* There are many opportunities to build your relationship with your client outside of the current work
  * Show they (their business) are important to you, e.g. call up and inquire how things are going
  * Don't just be visible, make an impact on the business
  * Help clients to think and develop strategies
    * What is the business going to look like in 5 to 10 years
  * Tell why the competitors are doing what they're doing
* Expend effort on getting to know the client's business and proactively offer suggestions for improvement

### 21. The Case of Cross-Selling

* Cross-selling: selling within an organization that's already a client at some level
* Involves mixture of new people from both buyers' and sellers' organizations, and therefore new relationships
  * The main issue is creation of trust in fragile new relationships where the expectations are high and internal political hurdles may be great
  * Institutional relationships are usefull, but can't be tapped until the personal relationships are established, and those must be done as if they were brand new
  * *Name and claim* the unspoken issues in each case
* Trust is mainly personal, not institutional, and not very transferable
* With proper trust the client may take the advisor's word that a colleague is trustworthy, but it's rarely enough
* To get client to sell to another client (within the same organization), address the "what's in it for me" question
  * Good performance will reflect well to the client who "brought" the new advisors in
  * There may be economics of scale when doing more work
  * Work done to other client may offer insights to the first
* Only do cross-selling if you believe that the new service is in the best interest of the client organization

### 22. The Quick-Impact List to Gain Trust

1. Listen to everything
  * Listen to understand and paraphrase to ensure you've understood correctly
2. Emphatize (for real)
  * Work hard at undestanding other people
  * "Why does he believe this? Where's he coming from? What causes him to think that way?"
3. Note what they're feeling
  * "You look excited today, what's going on?"
  * "You seem distracted, is something wrong?"
4. Build a shared agenda
  * Always start by sharing your idea of an agenda for the meeting and openly ask others to add their ideas
  * Show we-not-me attitude
5. Take personal risks
  * Put yourself "out there", even if you fear failing or losing respect etc
6. Ask great questions
  * Open-ended questions force you to not prejudge what you're hearing, either by biasing the speaker, or by enforcing artificial categories
  * Hear what the speaker has to say in their own terms
